                <h2>What are strange stars?</h2>
                <p>Strange stars are hypothetical astronomical objects composed of strange matter, also known as quark matter. Strange matter is made up of strange quarks, which are elementary particles that are difficult to observe. Strange stars may possess extraordinary properties, such as densities greater than neutron stars, as well as stability and durability. The existence of these objects is still the subject of scientific research and requires further observations and experiments to better understand their nature and confirm their existence.</p>
                <h2>How do they form?</h2>
                <p>The formation of strange stars is a theoretical scenario that assumes under extreme conditions of density and temperature, normal matter can undergo a transformation into strange matter. In the process of forming strange stars, the ordinary core of a star, consisting of protons and neutrons, undergoes a transformation, and strange quarks become the dominant constituents. This transformation leads to the formation of a structure where strange matter is present within the star. However, the process of forming strange stars is still a subject of research and requires further theoretical investigations and potential observations to confirm this hypothesis.</p>
